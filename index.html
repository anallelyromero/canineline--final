             	<p>All dog lovers want the same thing: for their friends to be happy and healthy. And one of the best ways to keep your pup content is to make sure he or she gets a good night’s rest after a long, hard day of playing.</p>

             	<p>Being pet owners ourselves, we wanted to create a bed fit for our own buddies, one that would not only keep them comfortable in their younger years, but provide therapeutic support as they grew older. We crafted the <strong>BuddyBed</strong> specifically for the pet owner who values their dog’s well-being.</p>

             	<p>The <strong>BuddyBed’s</strong> recycled styrofoam bead interior contours around your dog’s unique shape, providing a warm and wonderful night’s sleep. Your best friend will love sinking into one of our deluxe BuddyBeds, complete with a thick furry top for extra warmth and protection - helping your puppy stay snug and cozy all night long.</p>
